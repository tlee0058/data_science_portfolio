    - [Exploring Ebay Car Sales](https://github.com/tlee0058/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Exploring%20Ebay%20Car%20Sales.ipynb): A fun project to explore the online car sales ad to see what kind of cars people are most interested buying second-hand. I utilized all Pandas in this project.

    - [Exploring Gun Deaths in the US](https://github.com/tlee0058/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Exploring%20Gun%20Deaths%20in%20the%20US.ipynb): I retreived and utilized the data without using Numpy or Pandas. It's a project with bare Python use. In this project, I explored which race committed most gun related incidences.
