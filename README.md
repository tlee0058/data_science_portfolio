# Data Science Projects
Contents below are data analytics, visualization and science projects that I created as a learning tool for myself and a passion/interest. I update the portfolio daily. If you have any question or would like to reach out, here is my linkedin profile. [\[LinkedIn\]](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tingclee/)

## Categories
- ## Data Cleaning, exploration and analyses

    - [Exploring Ebay Car Sales](https://github.com/tlee0058/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Exploring%20Ebay%20Car%20Sales.ipynb): A fun project to explore the online car sales ad to see what kind of cars people are most interested buying as a second-hand car. I utilized Pandas in this project.

    - [Exploring Gun Deaths in the US](https://github.com/tlee0058/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Exploring%20Gun%20Deaths%20in%20the%20US.ipynb): I retreived and utilized the data without using Numpy or Pandas. It's a project with bare Python codes. In this project, I explored which race committed most gun related incidences.

- ## Data Visualizations

    - [Visualizing Earnings Based on College Majors](https://github.com/tlee0058/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Visualizing%20Earnings%20Based%20on%20College%20Majors.ipynb): I used Matplotlib to explore the data by plots such as Scatter, Bar, Histogram and Boxplot. They help me to find out which majors were the most and least popular; which majors are mostly dominated by male vs female; which majors had the highest pay, etc. I was also able to save the graphs into a separate png file.

    -[Analyizing NYC High School Data](https://github.com/tlee0058/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Analyzing%20NYC%20High%20School%20Data.ipynb): Using data from multiple sources and matplotlib, I explored which schools in NYC and which regions have the highest SAT scores.
- ## SQL

    -[Exploring CIA World Factbook using Python SQLite Workflow](https://github.com/tlee0058/data_science_portfolio/blob/fd0a2d729ab9c8b98104076fd26616fa3bd946e8/.ipynb_checkpoints/CIA%20World%20Factbook-checkpoint.ipynb): Using sqlite3 and Pandas, I explored which countries have the highest population density.

    -[Answering Business Questions](https://github.com/tlee0058/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Answering%20Business%20Questions%20using%20SQL.ipynb): Using sqlite3, Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib, I help a business to find out which genres of music are the most popular and which locations have the highest sales.

- ## Object-oriented Programming

    -[Analyzing NBA Players data](https://github.com/tlee0058/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Analyzing%20NBA%20players'%20data%20from%20the%202013-2014%20seasons.ipynb): Using Numpy and Python's OOP I organized the data is such a way that I can analyze the same sets of data with different basketball teams. I explored which team has the oldest players on average.

    -[Analyzing Chopsticks with different lengths to determine the best efficiency](https://github.com/tlee0058/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Analyzing%20chopsticks%20with%20different%20lengths%20to%20determine%20the%20best%20efficiency.ipynb): Using Numpy and Python's OOP I figured out what length of chopsticks are most efficiency for users.

- ## Machine Learning

    -[Predicting Car Prices](https://github.com/tlee0058/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Predicting%20Car%20Prices.ipynb): Using Pandas and Scikit-Learn tools, I predicted the future car prices by fitting a KNN model.

    -[Predicting House Sale Prices](https://github.com/tlee0058/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Predicting%20House%20Sale%20Prices.ipynb): Using Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn tools, I trained and tested a model to predict home prices.
